# 1. System requirements
This script was tested and run on the Windows 10 system in MATLAB 2022b. All systems that can install MATLAB software (versions after 2019) are expected to run. No non-standard hardware is required to run this script.

# 2. Installation guide
No installation process is needed if MATLAB software is ready.

# 3. Demo
Instructions to run on data: run the script and follow the annotation and description
Expected output: Plots of the frequency shits
Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer: usually 5 minutes

# 4. Instructions for use
Put the data and script code in the same folder, and then run the script file.
